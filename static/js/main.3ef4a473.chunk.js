I remember thinking 'there's no way I'll ever get this'. Commit, merge, push, pull, clone, init... the list goes on. I watched a tutorial on YouTube, but still didn't get the point of it. After this week, I fully get the point of it, why it matters, I see the ease of access and keeping everything organized.

I look forward to updating it weekly so you can follow along with my journey. I've had four jobs since I started working at 16. I was at my first job for two years, the second a year, the third eight years and my most recent job going on four years.

My favorite thing about this week was using CSS and Flexbox. I love styling pages and it really took me back to my Myspace days! I knew basic HTML & CSS before this week, so I dove into deeper subjects. This week our project was to recreate a Birdwatching website. I choose to do different colors and styling because I didn't enjoy the colors of the original, but I'm sure someone out there does! It was rewarding to finally have a project to put together and for it to actually come together. I plan on finding some cool things to do with CSS.

I can do this....I think.",questions:[{q1:"What is something you wish you could do but currently do not have the coding skills to accomplish?",a1:"I wish I had enough coding skills to code a simple game. I've always wanted to do this and cannot wait to be able to. I don't even care if it's a game as simple as snake. "},{q2:"What are you struggling with?",a2:"At the moment, I am struggling with remembering to commit while doing a project. I am also struggling with answering questions about git commands. I understand how to use them, what they do, and when to use them, but for some reason when I have to answer a question about them my mind goes blank. I'm going to work on this because maybe I'm missing a deeper understanding."},{q3:"How do you solve a problem?",a3:"I solve a problem by exhausting every resource. If I don't know how to do something I start by googling the topic, I skim through the top few websites and if it still doesn't clear up my understanding, I switch to YouTube. If I cannot understand something by reading about it, then I can normally understand it by hearing someone talk about it. I think I just had an a-ha! moment and realized I should start by hearing someone talk about the topic before reading about it. It could save me some time!"},{q4:"What methods do you use to help yourself get unstuck?",a4:"This sort of ties in to the question above, but I also want to add that a lot of times if I'm feeling stuck, I'll take a break.

It was challenging, there were moments that I wanted to scream (or did scream), and there were also moments of success! When the Javascript code that I wrote worked, I wanted to run around my house! It was such a great feeling. We were pushed to the limits this week. There were two projects this week. A silly story generator and an alarm clock. The silly story generator was essentially a walkthrough project, but the alarm clock was from scratch. When I first started, I stared at a blank screen for at least thirty minutes wrapping my head around how I was even going to start this, let alone finish. I started breaking it down. I thought about the functionality of an actual alarm clock. What does it need? ...and that's where I started. I researched, took many notes, bits and pieces of information from different resources and put it all together. I'm not 100% satisfied with what I presented, but it worked and it was good enough for me now. I plan on revisitng this project as I progress. I know it's only going to get more challenging from here.",questions:[{q1:"What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing a user experience?",a1:"I love the way everything works together to provide the user experience.

I am excited for the next couple of weeks to come, but I know there are many challenges ahead.",questions:[{q1:"What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?",a1:"Something that held me back this week was my staying in a standard way of thinking. I have been taught that there's only one way of thinking since growing up and breaking free from this will take me further than I've been.

"},{q3:"How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?",a3:"The In-Person part of the Bootcamp has been so eye opening to many different areas of my life.

I come from a small town in Eastern, KY. where no one is expected to \"win\" in life or \"get out\". I watched everything and everyone around me growing up. I watched the people I wanted to be like, the people I didn't want to be like and I always\n                    had a voice inside of me telling me that I was going to get out and make a successful life. In 2012, I started working at an Applebee's in Hazard, KY.\n                    Two years later I became a Manager and moved to Huntington, WV. This was a moment that changed my life and set the trajectory for the rest of my life.\n                    I worked for Applebee's until 2018 when I moved to Lexington, KY to take a position at J. Alexander's. I worked there for over three years and realized\n                    that I was wasting my time living a life that I still wasn't proud of. I was \"successful\" by the term of many people from back home, but I still didn't \n                    feel like my success meant anything to me. I have always been interested in coding and the web. I'll never forget the \"oo's and ahh's\" from\n                    creating fabulous MySpace pages that others envied. I found out about Awesome Inc. while driving downtown so I went to their website and the rest \n                    is history! I have no choice because I feel that my \"Why\" is now. I have been waiting my whole life for an opportunity to turn my life into something\n                    that I want it to be and for the first time, I took a leap of faith to escape and break the barrier that was built around me from the start.

I learned how I learn\n                    best this week and I know it set up a whole new level in my understanding of how things work. I was very focus on Pseudocode this week and I learned\n                    that it's one of the most, if not the most, important things to focus on. Last week I did Pseudocode as well, but nothing like this week. \n                    I just realized that the difference between my stress levels compared to this week and last could \n                    simply come down to my Pseudocode."},{q2:"What does it mean to develop good code?",a2:"Developing good code means that it is easy to read and efficient.

Pseudocode is nothing more than a plan written in your spoken language. There's no coding involved.\n                    Pseudocoding helps you understand the problem at hand and how you're going to find a solution to the problem. You wouldn't build a house without a blueprint and on a smaller \n                    scale, Pseudocode is the blueprint to your program. It's an informal way of writing the instructions to your programs procedures and functionality. There's no right or wrong \n                    way to write Pseudocode. The more you write it the better you'll find a structure that works for you. When you write good Pseudocode, you're in full control. Pseudocoding is \n                    important for understanding the question, breaking the problem down and arriving at a solution.

I can still remember our first computer with MS-DOS. There was a concentration memory card game that I was fascinated with and this is the first memory I have that started my passion for technology that I carried with me throughout the years. At 16, I started working in a restaurant and fell into the loop of being comfortable. I have more than fifteen years of experience in Hospitality, Food and Beverage Service and Guest Relations with five years in Restaurant Management. At the end of 2021, I decided to pursue a passion that hasn't left since I've been a child, step outside of my comfort zone and leave everything I've ever known. This leap of faith led me to Awesome Inc. Bootcamp to study Full Stack Development. While attending Awesome Inc, the technologies studied were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, React and Django. After Bootcamp, I was hired at Apax Software in Lexington, KY as a Software QA Specialist. At the moment, I am focused on futhering my knowledge in JavaScript, React and Django.")))};var oe=function(){return
