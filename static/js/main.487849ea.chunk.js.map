There was a concentration memory card game that I was fascinated with and this is the first \n                memory I have that started my passion for technology that I carried with me throughout the years. At 16, I started working in a restaurant and \n                fell into the loop of being comfortable. I have more than fifteen years of experience in Hospitality, Food and Beverage Service and Guest \n                Relations with five years in Restaurant Management. At the end of 2021, I decided to pursue a passion that hasn't left since I've been \n                a child, step outside of my comfort zone and leave everything I've ever known. This leap of faith led me to Awesome Inc. Bootcamp to \n                study Full Stack Development. While attending Awesome Inc, the technologies studied were HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, React and Django. After Bootcamp, I was hired\n                at Apax Software in Lexington, KY as a Software QA Specialist. At the moment, I am focused on futhering my knowledge in JavaScript, React and Django.</Col>\n            </Row>\n        </Container>\n    )\n}\n\nexport default About;","import NavBar from
